	BUG WITH THE TOASTS : After used most of the tiles, since I have toasts to check if the 			      selected tile is in the deck and if it has any available moves and if 				      fast switching to the random tile and selected couple of times 				      accumulates the toasts and it takes a lot of time for the screen to get 
 			      cleared.

	Not anymore bugs that I am aware of.
